<br>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
1. Open <b>Apex Legends</b>
<br>
2. Run <b>Apex Colour Aimbot.ahk</b>
<br>
3. Enter a game and enjoy!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Since this is a colour aimbot that locks on to anything red, you are required to use <b>Gold Optics</b> (Digital Threat)
<br>
It won't work with any other optic since enemies are not red, meaning that it won't be able to detect them.
<br>
This alone makes the script's functionality limited but it is still better than nothing.
